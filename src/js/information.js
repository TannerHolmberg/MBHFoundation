                <div className='bodyText'><p>Fentanyl is a lethal synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. It is cheap, easy to manufacture, and often mixed with other drugs, making it incredibly dangerous. Just a few grains of fentanyl can be fatal, and its presence in illicit drugs has caused a skyrocketing number of overdoses and deaths. Much of the fentanyl found in the United States is illegally smuggled across the border, often concealed within other goods or vehicles. Criminal organizations are exploiting vulnerabilities to flood communities with this deadly substance, leading to an unprecedented surge in overdose deaths. Each day, countless lives are shattered by fentanyl, leaving behind grieving families and devastated communities. This crisis affects people of all ages, backgrounds, and regions—no one is immune. It’s time to face the truth: Fentanyl kills.</p></div>

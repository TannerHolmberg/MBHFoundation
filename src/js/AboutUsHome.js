Until recently, we had never experienced drug abuse in our family. However, our lives were forever changed when our oldest son, Mason Bradley Holmberg, became addicted to drugs during college. <br></br><br></br> Despite our efforts to help him through multiple rehab stints and counseling, Mason tragically lost his life to fentanyl poisoning. This heartbreaking experience has fueled our mission to raise awareness about the dangers of fentanyl and addiction. We share Mason's story to honor his memory and prevent other families from facing the same devastating loss.</p></div></div>

                            <p>
                            We were an ordinary family of four until fentanyl tore us apart. Our son Mason thrived until college, where addiction took hold. Despite rehab and counseling, he was poisoned by fentanylâ€”a tragedy that blindsided our middle-class family. Now, we share Mason's story to save others from our heartbreak and honor the son we couldn't save.
